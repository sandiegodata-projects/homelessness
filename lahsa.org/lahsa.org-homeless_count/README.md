Components of the Homeless Count

Street Count (all census tracts): Captures a point in time estimate of the
unsheltered population.

Shelter Count (from Homeless Management Integration System): Captures the
homeless population in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and safe
havens. The shelter count in this dataset excludes Cal WORKS hotel/ motel
vouchers and domestic violence shelters for confidentiality reasons.

Youth Count (sample census tracts): Collaborative process with youth
stakeholders to better understand and identify homeless youth.

Demographic Survey (sample census tracts): Captures the demographic
characteristics of the unsheltered homeless population.

Notes

LAHSA does not recommend aggregating census tract-level data to calculate
numbers for other geographic levels. Due to rounding, the census tract-level
data may not add up to the total for Los Angeles City Council District,
Supervisorial District, Service Planning Area, or the Los Angeles Continuum of
Care.

The Los Angeles Continuum of Care does not include the Cities of Long Beach,
Glendale, and Pasadena and will not equal the countywide Homeless Count Total.

Street Count Data include persons found outside, including persons found living
in cars, vans, ca mpers/RVs, tents, and makeshift shelters. The conversion
factors used to estimate the number of persons found Iivi ng outside are the
following: For fa milies- Makeshift Shelter = 2.42, Car = 2.96, Van = 2.43, Ca
mper/RV = 3.35, Tent = 2.75; For Individuals- Makeshift Shelter 1.67, Car =
1.54, Van = 1.62, Camper/RV = 1.76, Tent = 1.52.
