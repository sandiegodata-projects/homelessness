This data project collects a variety of datasets related to homelessness in San
Diego, Los Angeles and the US. The main work of the project is to collet and
package data. The source packages are in the [Github repo for this
project](https://github.com/sandiegodata-projects/homelessness) and the built
datasets are in the San Diego Regional Data Library's data repository, in the
[Homelessness
collection.](https://data.sandiegodata.org/collections/homelessness/)

Additional datasets that are important for analyzing homeless issues are in the
[Urban Planning collection.
](https://data.sandiegodata.org/collections/urban-planning/)

For beginning analysts, we recommend doing analysis in Google Colab, a hosted
version of Jupyter Notebook. See this [Colab notebook for the San Diego 2018
PITC](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V2e77fMlddOsGJinbCZC7WWVHdC8MJ69)
 for an example of how to get started. Google Colab is particularly valuable
for shareing and commenting on notebooks.

An important related project is [digitizing maps from monthly counts of
Downtown San Diego homeless. ](https://downtown-homelesness.sandiegodata.org/)

If you'd like to formally join this project you can:
