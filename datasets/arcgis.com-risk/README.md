# Homelessness Risk Tutorial

ESRI [publishes a tutorial for creating maps for analyzing
homelesness](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/analytics/case-studies/la-county-homel
essness-2-pro-workflow.htm), with a link to the data used. Many of the data are
from lahsa.org and economicrt.org, but the package also includes many other
columns. The data download includes a .gdb file, which includes no
documentation, although there may be documentation in the HomelessnessPkg.ppkx
file.

For this data package, the files from the .gdb database have been converted to
GeoJSON, to be imported into the package.

The files are interesting, but poorly documented and of unknown provenance, so
probably should only be used for tutorials and demonstrations. Some information
about the dataset can be inferred from an [ESRI Homelessness Story
Map](https://eath.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=0c56e846dacb4663
926cdbc8570ea4f6), which appears to use these datasets.
