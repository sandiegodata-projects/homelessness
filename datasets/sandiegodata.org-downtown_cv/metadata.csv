Table.Column,intersection,string,,,
Table,intersection_regions,,,,
Table.Column,url,string,Url to a map image,,
Table.Column,neighborhood,string,Name of the neighborhood for the maps,,
Table.Column,year,integer,Year portion of the data collection date.,,
Table.Column,month,integer,Month portion of the data collection date.,,
Table.Column,intersections_id,string,A string composed of the names of the four intersections.,,
Table.Column,intersection_group,string,"A name, based on the neighbrhood, that identifies distinct intersection_id strings.",,
Table.Column,map_name,string,A name based on the neighborhood and map changes in 2016 and 2017,,
Table.Column,source_inv,string,"The intersection polygon, fromed from the intersection points,  in WKT format, in the pixel coordinate space. This version is inverted, with the Y coordinate being subtracted from 2000, so the orientation of the Y axis is the same as the EPSG:2230 geographic coordinate space.",,
Table.Column,source,string,"Like source_inv, but the Y axis is not inverted, so the coordinates are the same as the image.",,
Table.Column,source_area,number,"Area of source shape, in square pixels",,
Table.Column,source_shape,string,"(X,Y) shape of source polygon bounding box",,
Table.Column,source_shape_x,integer,X value of source_shape,,
Table.Column,source_shape_y,integer,Y value of source_shape,,
Table.Column,dest,string,"The intersection polygon, but in EPSG:2230 (State plane 6, California, Feet) coordinates.",,
Table.Column,matrix,string,"An affine transformation matric that transforms from the coorinates of source_inv to dest. When pixel locations are properly inverted, this matrix transforms from pixel locations to geographic locations.",,
