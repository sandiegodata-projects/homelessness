# HUD Project Level Housing Inventory, Multiple years

DUring the annual Point in Time Count, HUD also collects information about
sheltered homeless, with detailed information about housing projects, including
number of beds, occupancy, funding, and many other variables.

There is no formal data dictionary, so the dataset is lighly documented; the meaning of the fields is probably part of the HDX web application.
